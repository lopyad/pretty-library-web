  <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a styling language used to add visual styles to HTML content. It enables web designers to control the appearance of a web page by defining how elements should be displayed, such as the font, color, size, and layout. CSS can be used to create complex layouts and responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes and devices.</p>

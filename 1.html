  <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a set of elements that define different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. HTML uses a tag-based system where each tag is enclosed in angle brackets and contains information about the content it represents.</p>

  <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
  
  <p><strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a set of elements that define different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. HTML uses a tag-based system where each tag is enclosed in angle brackets and contains information about the content it represents.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a styling language used to add visual styles to HTML content. It enables web designers to control the appearance of a web page by defining how elements should be displayed, such as the font, color, size, and layout. CSS can be used to create complex layouts and responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
  
  <p>Both HTML and CSS are essential for creating modern web pages that are functional, visually appealing, and accessible to users. They are the backbone of the web and form the foundation upon which more advanced technologies, such as JavaScript and server-side programming, can be built.</p>
  
  <p>In summary, HTML provides the structure and content of web pages, while CSS adds visual styles and layout. Together, they form the building blocks of the web and are essential skills for anyone looking to create websites or web applications.</p>

  <p><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is a high-level programming language used primarily to create interactive web applications. It is a dynamic, object-oriented language that can be used to add functionality to web pages, create standalone applications, or build full-stack web applications using popular frameworks such as React or Angular. JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create modern web experiences. With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now also be used on the server-side, allowing for seamless full-stack development. As a versatile and ubiquitous language, JavaScript has become an essential skill for web developers.</p>
